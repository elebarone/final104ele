    <pre><code>On a crisp autumn morning at Allegheny College, students shuffled into a brightly lit classroom, ready for another session of Document Engineering. Professor Hayes, known for her engaging teaching style, greeted the class with a warm smile.

"Good morning, everyone," she said, setting down her coffee mug. "Today’s class will be a bit different. I want you to think about what makes a document useful and intuitive."

The students exchanged curious glances as Professor Hayes handed out examples of various digital documents—some were sleek and professional, while others were cluttered and confusing.

"Your task," she continued, "is to analyze these and identify what works and what doesn’t. By the end of today’s session, I want each of you to sketch out improvements for one of these documents."

Among the students were Mia and Oliver, both eager to dive into the assignment. Mia selected a convoluted webpage with mismatched fonts and confusing navigation, while Oliver chose a cluttered event flyer.

"This webpage feels like a maze," Mia muttered to Oliver as they worked side by side. "I can’t even tell where to start."

Oliver chuckled. "This flyer is worse. I think they used five different fonts. It’s giving me a headache."

Throughout the class, Professor Hayes moved around the room, offering feedback and encouragement. "Remember," she said, "a well-designed document doesn’t just look good—it communicates effectively."

As the session wrapped up, the students presented their ideas. Mia proposed a streamlined layout for her webpage, emphasizing clear navigation and consistent styling. Oliver’s redesign focused on simplifying the flyer’s content and using a cohesive color scheme.

"Great work, everyone," Professor Hayes said, nodding in approval. "Keep these principles in mind as we move forward. Document design is an evolving process, and there’s always room for improvement."

Walking out of class, Mia turned to Oliver. "This was actually pretty fun."

"Yeah," Oliver agreed. "It’s like solving a puzzle—but with words and layouts."

The students headed off to their next classes, feeling inspired by the day’s discussion and ready to tackle the challenges ahead.
