## Objective
The objective of this final project is to research and document the functionalities of the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground/). You will create a comprehensive user manual in both Markdown (.md) and HTML (.html), convert it to a static website using Jekyll, Gatsby, or another static site generator (SSG), and deploy the site using GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create a Detailed User Manual (`index.html`)
- In the `/writing` directory, create a well-structured `index.html` file for the OpenAI Playground. The manual should include:
  - **Introduction**: Brief overview of the OpenAI Playground.
  - **Overview of Features**: Highlight key features and capabilities.
  - **Step-by-Step Guide**: Provide a detailed guide to using essential features.
  - **Tips and Best Practices**: Share tips for effective usage.
  - **Examples**: Include at least one example demonstrating the use of the OpenAI Playground.
  - **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**: Address common questions.

### Part 2: Create a Markdown Manual (`final.md`)
- In the `/writing` directory, create one `final.md` file that serves as a user manual for the OpenAI Playground.
- The Markdown manual should reflect the same content as the `index.html`.

### Part 3: Convert the Manual into a Static Website
- Use Jekyll, Gatsby, or another Static Site Generator (SSG) of your choice to convert the manual into a static website. 
- Include the following:
  - **Homepage**: A brief introduction with navigation links.
  - **Dedicated Pages**: Create separate pages for each section of the user manual based on the content of `final.md` in `/writing`.

### Part 4: Deploy the Static Website
- Deploy the final static site using GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- Ensure the site is publicly accessible.
- Replace the marker below with the URL of the deployed site.

### Notes
- **Naming**: Ensure the HTML file is named exactly `index.html` and Markdown file is named exactly `final.md`.
- **HTML Structure**: Use appropriate HTML tags to structure the document, including:
  - **Header Tags**: Use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc., for headings.
  - **Text Formatting**: Use `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italic, etc.
  - **Tables**: Use `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`, etc., for tabular data.
  - **Lists**: Use `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` for ordered and unordered lists.
  - **Links**: Use `<a href="">` to include hyperlinks.
  - **Images**: Use `<img>` to add images.

## Deliverables
Please submit your work by pushing it to your GitHub Classroom repository.
- Ensure the `/writing` directory contains:
  - One `index.html` file.
  - One `final.md` file reflecting the content of the user manual.
- Modify the `README.md` file to include:
  - The URL of your deployed site, either on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## Project Assessment

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

### 1. Completion of Project Components (60%)
- **Criteria**: Completing the 4 main parts of the project as outlined in the instructions.
- **Base Score**: Projects that generally complete all 4 parts will receive the full 60% in this category.
  - Part 1: Creating `index.html` with required sections.
  - Part 2: Creating `final.md` file as a user manual.
  - Part 3: Converting the manual into a static website.
  - Part 4: Deploying the static website successfully.

### 2. Achieve GatorGrader Compliance (10%)
- **Criteria**: Successfully meeting the criteria set by GatorGrader.

### 3. Quality of Work (30%)
- **Criteria**: Assessed based on the overall quality and attention to detail in the following areas:
  - **Content Quality**: Clarity, completeness, and coherence of the user manual.
  - **HTML and Markdown Structure**: Proper use of HTML and Markdown syntax.
  - **Static Website Design**: Aesthetics, navigation, and adherence to the required layout.
  - **Deployment**: Functionality of the deployed website (links, images, responsiveness, etc.).
